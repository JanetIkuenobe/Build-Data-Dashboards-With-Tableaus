## Project Title 
Build-Data-Dashboards-With-Tableau

## Project Description
Flight delay and cancellations seems to be a big issue in the United States. In this
project, I have made a dashboard of sum of flight cancellations in each states by day
of week and also found reasons for flight cancellations and Airports with sum of their
cancelled flights by months.

For this project I used a Business Intelligent Tool like Tableau because it provides an excellent visualization and also it is easy to implement
